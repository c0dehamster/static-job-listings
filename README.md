## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I used this challenge to finally try using React since knowing React seems to be a requirement for a web developer. This decision made this project more difficult for me than it could have been.

The biggest thing I missed in React compared to Svelte (apart from built-in observables, style scoping, overall less boilerplate, and easy-to-read, informative error messages) was reactive assignments. On the positive side, every time I struggled to make something work I could easily look it up in others' solutions. React docs are also very detailed and easy to understand.

I tried to create react app with NextJS but scrapped that idea as I wasn't going to use any Next-specific functions anyway. Instead, I used Vite, and it worked fine for me.

### Continued development

I am pretty sure that if I am ever going to work on an actual project, it will be built with React.
